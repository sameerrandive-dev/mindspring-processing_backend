# ✨ MindSpring Roadmap & Ecosystem Features

MindSpring is designed to be the ultimate companion for learners, researchers, and professionals. Our platform bridges the gap between raw data and actionable knowledge through an integrated suite of AI-powered tools.

## 📓 1. Notebook-Centric Learning Ecosystem
Transform static documents into dynamic learning hubs. The Notebook is the core organizational unit of MindSpring.

### 📥 Multi-Source Intelligent Ingestion
Upload and aggregate an unlimited number of sources within a single notebook to create a combined knowledge base:
- **Batch Processing**: Upload multiple **PDFs**, **Markdown files**, and **URLs** to study them as a collective unit.
- **Unified Indexing**: Our pipeline extracts and contextually indexes all sources into a single vectorized space for cross-document synthesis.

### 🛠️ AI-Generated Learning Artifacts
Once a source is added, you can generate structured content in seconds:
- **Summaries**: Get the "TL;DR" in concise, educational, or creative styles.
- **Study Guides**: Comprehensive, structured outlines that break down complex topics into digestible sections.
- **Quizzes**: Test your knowledge immediately with auto-generated assessments (see below).
- **Mindmaps**: Visualize connections between concepts (see below).

### 💬 Collaborative Multi-Source RAG
Chat with your entire notebook library at once.
- **Cross-Source Synthesis**: The AI retrieves relevant context from multiple different documents to answer complex queries that span across your library.
- **Grounded Responses**: Every answer is backed by specific chunks from any of your sources, complete with citations.
- **Deep Historical Context**: Syntra remembers your entire conversational thread across sources for a seamless learning experience.

### ⚡ 2. Syntra Pulse (Precision Assessments)
Turn any source or notebook into a rigorous testing ground. Syntra Pulse allows for precise control over your knowledge validation.
- **Customizable Question Pulses**: Generate assessments in increments of **10, 20, 30, 40, or up to 50 questions** in a single generation.
- **Difficulty Grading**:
    - **Novice (Introductory)**: Focuses on core definitions and broad concepts.
    - **Intermediate**: Covers relationships between ideas and process-based questions.
    - **Master (Advanced)**: Rigorous testing involving deep inference and complex synthesis.
- **Immediate Feedback**: (Upcoming) Rationales for every answer to turn "wrong" into "know".
- **Source-to-Quiz**: Narrow down the pulse to a specific source or synthesize a quiz from your entire notebook collection.

## 🤖 3. Syntra: Your Intelligent AI Assistant
Beyond specific notebooks, **Syntra** is available as a dedicated, standalone chat experience for general learning and assistance.

- **Learn-as-you-Chat**: Syntra doesn't just give answers; it explains concepts, simplifies jargon, and encourages critical thinking.
- **Full Context Memory**: Engage in long, meaningful dialogues where Syntra tracks the entire narrative of your learning journey.
- **Versatile Modes**: Switch between "Tutor Mode", "Fact-Checker", or "Brainstormer" to suit your immediate needs.

---

## 🧠 4. Visual Knowledge Graphs (Mindmaps)
Visualize the hierarchy of knowledge. MindSpring helps you see the "big picture" by mapping out relationships between ideas.

- **Source-to-Mindmap**: Automatically extract the core hierarchy from your sources and render it as a visual graph.
- **Text-to-Mindmap**: Simply describe a concept, and MindSpring will structure it into a logical branched tree.
- **Interactive Node Threading**: Every node in your mindmap is an entry point for deeper learning. You can click any concept node to start a contextual AI conversation thread, allowing you to ask follow-up questions about that specific specific branch.
- **Multiple Formats**: Export or view your maps in **Mermaid**, **JSON**, or interactive visual nodes.
